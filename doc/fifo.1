.SH DESCRIPTION
This program allows to use the HTTP/REST API provided by Project FiFo from
the console and interact with it in a scripted manner.
.PP
Configuration data for the endpoint can either be passed via the commadline
arguments or via the config file located (~/.fifo).

.TP
\-p
as part of any
.B list
command the \-p option outputs the data in parsable format sepperating
the columns by a ':'
.TP

command the \-H option will supress the header to be printed making
parsing easyer
.TP

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
datasets list [\-p] [\-H] [\-\-fmt FMT]
This command lists the datasets currently available on the server.

Valid choices for
.B FMT
are: uuid, name, version, type and description.
.TP
datasets get <uuid>
This command returns the JSON representation of a dataset object
stored in the fifo server.
.TP
datasets delete <uuid>
Deletes a dataset from the FiFo server, also the linked image will
be removed from the database.

this can't be undone!

No VM's running the dataset will be affected and the dataset will
.B NOT
be removed from the hypervisors.
.TP

This command lists the dtrace scripts currently available on the
server.

Valid choices for
.B FMT
are: uuid and name.
.TP
dtrace get <uuid>
This command returns the JSON representation of a dtrace script
object stored in the fifo server.

.TP
vms snapshots <vm uuid> delete <uuid>

.TP
vms snapshots <vm uuid> rollback <uuid>
